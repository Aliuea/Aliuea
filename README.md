New Developer in training. Asian (Lao/Chinese) male. He/Him pronouns. Used to work quite a bit in manual related jobs, 4 year bio degree, active and currently excited to work on some acro yoga and indoor bouldering, and I have no pets (will say I'm more of a cat person though I don't mind small dogs like Dachshunds)
